### Before you start... 
Use this ***script*** at your own risk. Prepare yourself
to receive a lot of messages. There is a maximum amount of connections,
`30000`, that once reached will not allow you to add more people. LinkedIn
servers will block you temporarily after adding a few thousand
connections.
I never reached this limit, so I can't precise how much. I
made over `1000` new connection requests without any issues.

## The script
might not work if your screen is too big or too small. Sometimes, web
pages render different elements and the selectButtonElements function
might need to be adapted. Install Google Chrome. Might work on other
browsers... How to use it Open the My Network page on LinkedIn. Make
sure your LinkedIn is in English. If not you might need to change the
button string [Connect] inside the function selectButtonElements.

===> Step 1: Open Brave Dev Tools
===> FYI: Please note that the functionality described is not compatible with the Chrome browser
===> It only works on the Brave browser. Additionally,
===> Be aware that approximately 15 minutes after the scripts start running,
===> LinkedIn may detect this automated activity and block you,
===> Accompanied by a notification indicating that automated processes are operating in the system
===> Step 2: Paste the script below in the console, press enter, and wait.
